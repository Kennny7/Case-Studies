# Logistic Regression Assignment

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a logistic regression model to solve the problem faced by X Education, an online course provider. The goal is to predict the likelihood of lead conversion based on historical data, thereby improving the efficiency of the sales process by focusing on high-potential leads ("Hot Leads").

The model assigns a lead score to each lead, enabling the sales team to prioritize their efforts and increase the company's conversion rate from 30% to a target of 80%.
