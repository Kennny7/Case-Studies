# Case Studies Repository

Welcome to the **Case Studies** repository! This project is a collection of practical and well-documented case studies across various domains, primarily focused on **data science, machine learning, and analytics**. Each case study explores a unique problem and provides a comprehensive solution, featuring various methodologies and real-world applications.

## What is Inside?

This repository consists of multiple **nested case studies** — each housed within its own directory under the main folder. These case studies showcase different predictive modeling techniques, data analysis projects, and machine learning algorithms.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
/Case-Studies
│
├── /Optimizing Lead Conversion A Predictive Model for X Education (Logistic Regression)
│   ├── /README.md
│   ├── /Logistic_Regression.ipynb
│   ├── /Leads.csv
│   ├── /Assignment Subjective Questions.docx
│   └── /requirements.txt
│
├── /[Upcoming Case Study Name]
│   ├── /README.md
│   ├── /[Files...]
└── /README.md
└── /LICENSE.md

```

- **Each case study** folder contains:
  - **README.md** – Explaining the problem statement, methodology, and results.
  - **.ipynb** files – Jupyter notebooks for code execution and analysis.
  - **Data files** – Datasets used for analysis (e.g., `.csv`, `.xlsx`).
  - **Supporting documentation** – Additional context, reports, or resources.

## Current Case Studies

### 1. **Optimizing Lead Conversion: A Predictive Model for X Education (Logistic Regression)**  
   Dive into this case study where we explore the power of **logistic regression** for predicting lead conversion rates in an educational setup. The case study includes:
   - Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
   - Building and evaluating a logistic regression model.
   - Improving model accuracy using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Getting Started

To explore the case studies on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kennny7/Case-Studies.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the repository**:
   ```bash
   cd Case-Studies
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   Inside each case study folder, you’ll find a `requirements.txt` file that lists the necessary Python libraries. Install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start exploring**:
   Open the Jupyter notebooks or dive straight into the **README.md** of each case study to get a detailed understanding.
